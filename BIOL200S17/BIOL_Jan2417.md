## 2nd, 3rd, 4th structures

1.  Ionic: stong.
2.  Hydrogren bonding: hydration shell.
    -   responsible for 2ndary structures.
3.  Van der Vaals: weak
4.  Hydrophobic interactions: **NOT BONDS**, reducing needs for highly ordered water molecules.
    -   Bond strength:
        1.  Van
        2.  Ionic
        3.  Hbond
        4.  C-C
        5.  C=C

## 2ndary structure's rules

1.  Xray diffraction: interatomic bond distances, angles of amino acids chains.
2.  Theoreticral analysis of angles
3.  **Something else here yo.**
    -   Planar rotation limitations
        1.  \phi
        2.  \psi
4.  Alpha-helix with **3.6** amino acids/turn
    -   Rise from one alphacarbon-alphacarbond is 1.5 angstrom
