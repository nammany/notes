## 2nd, 3rd, 4th structures

1.  Ionic: stong.
2.  Hydrogren bonding: hydration shell.
    -   responsible for 2ndary structures.
3.  Van der Vaals: weak
4.  Hydrophobic interactions: **NOT BONDS**, reducing needs for highly ordered water molecules.
    -   Bond strength:
        1.  Van
        2.  Ionic
        3.  Hbond
        4.  C-C
        5.  C=C

## 2ndary structure's rules

1.  Xray diffraction: interatomic bond distances, angles of amino acids chains.
2.  Theoreticral analysis of angles
3.  **Something else here yo.**
    -   Planar rotation limitations
        1.  \phi
        2.  \psi
4.  Alpha-helix with **3.6** amino acids/turn
    -   Rise from one alphacarbon-alphacarbond is 1.5 angstrom

5.  Pitch is 5.4 Angstrom
6.  Linus' mistake<br\>
    -   L steriomer
    -   Rght handed helix
7.  Helix or not?
    1.  Similarly charged residues disrupts helixformation.
    2.  If too many large aminoacids consecutively, helix disrupted.
    3.  Bonding between R groups 3-4 residues apart stabilize.
    4.  P destabilizes helix; **Proline destabilizes**.
    5.  Negative N terminus, positive C terminus stabilizes helix.
        -   Leads to dipole across peptide bond.
8.  Circular dichroism
    -   Random coil, betasheet, alphahelix interact with light differently.
    -   Measures amount of secondary structures.
9.  Betasheet
    -   3.5 angstrom between adjacent amino acids, vs. 1.5 in alphahelix.
    -   Fully extended.
    -   Antiparallel arrangemet of adjacent betastrands.
    -   Adjacent polypeptide strands an be parallel or antiparallel.
