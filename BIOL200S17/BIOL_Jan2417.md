## 2nd, 3rd, 4th structures

1. Ionic: stong.
2. Hydrogren bonding: hydration shell.

  - responsible for 2ndary structures.

3. Van der Vaals: weak

4. Hydrophobic interactions: **NOT BONDS**, reducing needs for highly ordered water molecules.

  - Bond strength:

    1. Van
    2. Ionic
    3. Hbond
    4. C-C
    5. C=C

## 2ndarystructure's rules

1. Xray diffraction: interatomic bond distances, angles of amino acids chains.
2. Theoreticral analysis of angles
3. **Something else here yo.**

  - Planar rotation limitations

    1. \phi
    2. \psi

4. Alpha-helix with **3.6** amino acids/turn

  - Rise from one alphacarbon-alphacarbond is 1.5 angstrom

## Jan 26, 2017

1. Pitch is 5.4 Angstrom
2. Linus' mistake

  <br\>
  </br\>

  - L steriomer
  - Rght handed helix

3. Helix or not?

  1. Similarly charged residues disrupts helixformation.
  2. If too many large aminoacids consecutively, helix disrupted.
  3. Bonding between R groups 3-4 residues apart stabilize.
  4. P destabilizes helix; **Proline destabilizes**.
  5. Negative N terminus, positive C terminus stabilizes helix.

    - Leads to dipole across peptide bond.

4. Circular dichroism

  - Random coil, betasheet, alphahelix interact with light differently.
  - Measures amount of secondary structures.

5. Betasheet

  - 3.5 angstrom between adjacent amino acids, vs. 1.5 in alphahelix.
  - Fully extended.
  - Antiparallel arrangemet of adjacent betastrands.
  - Adjacent polypeptide strands an be parallel or antiparallel.

6. Folding

  - Fewer than 1/billion random polypeptides folds into organized structures.
  - Folding energy is low; most protein close to unfolded state.
  - Genes encoded for folding seleted by evolution.
  - Folded diffently every time.

7. Particular 3D _motifs/domain_ in secondary structures; associated with particula functions.

  1. Helixloophelix

    - Coordinate **negatively** ions amongst them
    - Calmodulin changes confirmation dramatically when binded to Ca+ ions.

  2. Zinc fingers; some transcription proteins have _multiple_ zingfingers.

  3. Coiled-coiled

    - Appear in proteins with diverse functions.

  4. SH2 and SH3 motifs

    - SH2 binds **pY**
    - SH3 binds **poly-P**

### Signaltransduction (part of supersecondarymotiff)

1. How proteins in cytoplasm knows someting has bouded to external face of membrane bound receptor?

  - Ligand binding may induce _dimerization_ or _oligomerization_

    - May induce conformational changes.

2. How insulin relates to diabetes?

  - P-zation of insulin receptor at Y residues allows these following to bind:
  - **GRB2**
  - **IRS1**
  - **PIP**
  - _**Look into insulin signaling**_

3. Adapter protein

  - **Pope of protein**
  - Functions as scaffold; making linkages with SH2, PTB, SH32 etc.
  - Bring substrates into contact with enzyme.

### Tertiarystructure

1. _Fibrous_ and _globular_ proteins.

  - Membrane protein is such example.

2. **GPCR**, or **Seven membranespanningprotein** in Rhodopsin.
