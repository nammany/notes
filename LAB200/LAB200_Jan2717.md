# 5 types of organisms

- Heterotrophs
- Autotrophs

- How elements cycle in water, on land.

## Why ribosomal DNA?

- 18S/28S
- Quite fundamental, every organisms would have them. **conservative**

### What's considered as new species?

- 99%+? differences in DNA TODO: check to make sure.

#### Lab

- Look into dilution.
- Print two lab assignments. Tape one, turn in the other.

- Record samples information in notebook.

  - Sample name, description.
  - Sample ID
  - Date

- Get six agar plate, two microcentrifugetubes, **15 mL** sea water.
- Label tubes and plates with:

  - Sample ID
  - Date
  - Initials
  - Dilution

- Vortex for 30 sec.
- Wipe
